    steps:
      - name: Checkout first
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Add/Update badges
        id: badges
        uses: trsvchn/colab-badge-action@v3
        with:
          check: "all"
          track: true
          target_branch: main
          target_repository: user/user-repo

      - name: Use your favorite commit&push action here
        uses: action/commit@push
        with: ...
```
